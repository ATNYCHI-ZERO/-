# DARPA Audit Report

## Repository Overview
- **Repository name:** `-`
- **Audit date:** 2025-11-11T00:39:19Z
- **Auditor:** Autonomous agent (ChatGPT)

## Files Reviewed
All files in the repository root were reviewed:
1. `README.md`

The `README.md` file contains a conceptual paper titled "Object-Centered Pi Collapse and Lattice Rotation as a Regenerative Mechanism." No executable code or configuration files are present.

## Testing Status
No automated tests or executable artifacts are provided in this repository. As such, there are no tests to run. The absence of code means there are no operational components whose functionality can be verified through execution.

## Findings
- The repository currently serves as documentation only.
- No compliance or operational issues were detected because there are no executable components to validate.

## Recommendations
- If future development introduces executable code or tooling, include automated tests (e.g., unit or integration tests) and document execution steps within the repository to support ongoing audits.
- Provide versioning or change logs if the document is updated frequently to maintain traceability for future audits.
