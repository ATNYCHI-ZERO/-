# DARPA Audit Report

## Scope
All repository files were reviewed as part of the DARPA readiness audit. The repository currently contains the following tracked artefacts:

- `README.md`

No additional source code, configuration, or test assets are present at this time.

## Review Findings
- **File integrity**: `README.md` was inspected manually to confirm accessibility and completeness. No structural issues were observed.
- **Test coverage**: The project does not ship with automated tests or runnable components. As such, no execution-based verification could be performed. This absence is documented for transparency.
- **Operational status**: With no executable modules or services available, there are no runtime behaviours to validate. The repository is effectively a documentation archive in its current state.

## Recommendations
1. Introduce versioned source code or implementation artefacts if functional deliverables are expected in future milestones.
2. Provide automated validation (unit/integration tests) alongside any new functionality to enable reproducible DARPA compliance checks.
3. Maintain this audit log and expand it as the codebase evolves to preserve traceability of future assessments.

## Conclusion
All existing files have been reviewed. The repository consists solely of documentation; consequently, no operational issues were identified, and no tests were executed.
