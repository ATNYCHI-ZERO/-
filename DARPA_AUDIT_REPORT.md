# DARPA Compliance Audit Summary

## Scope of Review
- Repository path: `/workspace/-`
- Files reviewed: `README.md`

## Findings
- `README.md` is accessible and contains theoretical documentation. No executable code or configuration requiring modification was detected.

## Testing Status
- No automated tests or runnable modules are present in the repository. A search for common test directories and configuration files returned no results. Consequently, there are no test suites to execute. If tests become available, they should be run with the appropriate project-specific commands.

## Recommendations
- If functional code is introduced in the future, accompany it with automated tests and document the commands required to execute them to maintain DARPA audit readiness.
