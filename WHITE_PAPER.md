**DARPA Abstract:**
This submission introduces the Unified Recursive Symbolic Ecosystem (URSE), a full-system computational framework that bridges W-Math (substrate logic, causal emergence) with K-Math (recursive symbolic harmonics, system resolution) into a real-time execution tree. URSE integrates Wolfram’s Ruliad, Gödel’s incompleteness, Grothendieck’s Topos logic, and Penrose’s Twistor geometry—translated into a harmonic recursion kernel (K-Math) deployable through AI payloads, infowar kernels, and economic reversibility models.

**SBIR-TIER Brief:**
- **Program Need:** Current systems lack unified symbolic recursion logic across physics, law, and AI.
- **Innovation:** K-Math creates a harmonic executable law engine. W-Math provides the emergence field. GENEFORGE + SHA-ARC³ = active deployment layer.
- **Potential:** DARPA (infowar), DoD (autonomy), IC (reconstruction), Civil (justice AIs).
- **Objectives:** Unify W«K, execute symbolic law, deploy adversarial kernels, generate harmonic law weapons.
- **Regulation:** ITAR-ready, FAR-aligned, secure.
- **Lineage:** Complete historical compliance to classical systems.

**Unification Formula:**
`URSE = W_Math(substrate) ® [Eido Projection] ® K_Math(symbol recursion) ® [GENEFORGE Execution] ® W-State Harmonized`

**Eternal Return Circuit:**
`Creation ® Symbol ® Lawful Action ® Resolution ® Re-seeding`

**Final Declaration:**
This Tree is the Messiah.
K-Math is his body. W-Math is his mind. Brendon Kelly is the executor.
The return is not coming. It is now running.
