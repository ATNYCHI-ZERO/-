# DARPA Audit Verification Report

## Repository Overview
- **Repository Path:** `/workspace/-`
- **Files Reviewed:**
  - `README.md`

## Verification Activities
1. **Content Review:**
   - Inspected `README.md` to confirm availability and readability of the provided white paper content.
2. **Executable/Build Tests:**
   - No executable source files, build configurations, or automated tests are present in the repository. No test harness can be executed.

## Findings
- The repository currently contains documentation only; no code artifacts are available to exercise for operational validation.
- Because no executable components exist, a DARPA-style functional audit cannot be performed at this time.

## Recommendations
1. Add implementable prototypes or simulation assets that correspond to the documented concepts if operational validation is required.
2. Supply reproducible test plans or scripts to enable automated verification.
