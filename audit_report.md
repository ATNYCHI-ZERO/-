# DARPA Audit Report

All repository files have been reviewed. The repository currently contains the following artifacts:

- `README.md`

No automated tests or executable modules were found, so no test suite was run. Manual inspection confirmed that the existing documentation renders as plain text without execution requirements.

# DARPA Audit Verification Report

## Repository Overview
- Repository contains conceptual documentation in `README.md` describing the AEGIS-INVICTA† platform.

## File Review Summary
- `README.md`: Reviewed entire document for completeness and clarity. No runtime or executable components present.

## Testing Status
- No automated tests or executable code detected in repository.
- Verification step: Confirmed repository contents limited to documentation; no build or runtime artifacts to execute.

## Conclusion
- Documentation reviewed with no issues detected.
- No further action required for operational readiness at this time.
# DARPA Compliance Audit Report

## Repository Overview
- **Repository Name:** -
- **Audit Date:** 2025-11-10T13:42:55Z
- **Auditor:** Automated Analysis via ChatGPT (gpt-5-codex)

## Files Reviewed
All files in the repository were inspected:
1. `README.md`

## Findings
- The repository currently contains only documentation (`README.md`).
- No executable code, scripts, or configuration files are present.
- No automated tests are defined; running `pytest` confirms that there are no test cases discovered.

## Test Execution Summary
```
pytest
```
- Result: No tests collected.

## Recommendations
- If executable code is added in the future, include corresponding automated tests to ensure continued compliance.
- Maintain documentation updates alongside code changes for traceability.

## Conclusion
The repository consists solely of documentation at the time of this audit. No functional issues were detected because there is no executable code to verify. The repository is compliant with documentation-only expectations but lacks test coverage due to the absence of code.
# DARPA Audit Readiness Report

- Repository contents reviewed on 2025-11-10T13:36:09Z.
- Files inspected:
  - README.md
- No executable code or automated test suites were present in the repository.
- Recommended action: integrate automated validation artifacts when code is added in the future.
# DARPA Audit Verification Report

## Repository Overview
- **Repository Path:** `/workspace/-`
- **Files Reviewed:**
  - `README.md`

## Verification Activities
1. **Content Review:**
   - Inspected `README.md` to confirm availability and readability of the provided white paper content.
2. **Executable/Build Tests:**
   - No executable source files, build configurations, or automated tests are present in the repository. No test harness can be executed.

## Findings
- The repository currently contains documentation only; no code artifacts are available to exercise for operational validation.
- Because no executable components exist, a DARPA-style functional audit cannot be performed at this time.

## Recommendations
1. Add implementable prototypes or simulation assets that correspond to the documented concepts if operational validation is required.
2. Supply reproducible test plans or scripts to enable automated verification.
