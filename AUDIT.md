# DARPA Audit Summary

## Repository Overview
- Repository contains a single documentation file: `README.md`.
- No executable code, configuration, or test suites are present.

## Review Findings
- `README.md` reviewed in full; contents comprise speculative research essay titled "Object-Centered Pi Collapse and Lattice Rotation as a Regenerative Mechanism".
- No build artifacts, scripts, or binaries detected.

## Testing Status
- No automated or manual tests executed because the repository lacks runnable code or test definitions.

## Recommendations
- Define project scope and add implementation artifacts if functionality is intended.
- Introduce reproducible testing strategy once executable components exist.
