# DARPA Audit Readiness Report

## Repository Overview
- Total files inspected (excluding VCS metadata): 1
- Files reviewed: `README.md`
- Primary content: Conceptual white paper describing harmonic scalar logic for chemistry compression.

## Findings
- No executable source code, scripts, or configuration files were present in the repository.
- No automated tests or continuous integration configurations were provided.
- Repository currently serves as documentation only; no runnable components identified.

## Testing Status
- No tests were run because the project contains no testable code or test harnesses.

## Recommendations
1. Provide source code or implementation details if operational validation is required.
2. Introduce automated test suites alongside any future executable components.
3. Maintain documentation of verification procedures once code is introduced.
