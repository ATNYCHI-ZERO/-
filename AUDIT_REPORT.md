# DARPA Audit Verification Report

## Repository Overview
- Repository root: `/workspace/-`
- Files reviewed:
  - `README.md` – conceptual whitepaper describing "Object-Centered Pi Collapse" framework.

## Audit Findings
- Documentation integrity: The existing `README.md` file was successfully read without errors.
- Code artifacts: No executable code or scripts were present in the repository.
- Test suites: No automated tests or tooling configurations were provided; consequently, no test execution was possible.

## Verification Summary
Because this repository currently consists solely of documentation, there are no runnable components to validate. Should executable modules or test harnesses be added in the future, rerun the DARPA audit with the appropriate commands to confirm operational readiness.
