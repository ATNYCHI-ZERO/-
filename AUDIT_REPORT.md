# DARPA Compliance Audit Report

## Repository Overview
- Repository contains a single document: `README.md` describing the "Object-Centered Pi Collapse" concept.
- No executable code, build scripts, or configuration files are present.

## File Review Summary
| File | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| README.md | Reviewed | Conceptual white paper; no implementation artifacts detected. |

## Testing Status
- No automated or manual tests were run because the repository does not contain executable source code or test harnesses.
- Recommend adding verifiable implementations and corresponding test suites for future audits.

## Conclusion
Repository is documentation-only at this time. No actionable binaries or scripts were identified for DARPA readiness verification.
# DARPA Audit Verification

- Files inspected:
  - README.md: Confirmed readable and accessible; contains theoretical exposition only.
- Automated test suites: None provided in repository; no executable code to validate.
- Manual verification: Not applicable beyond content review due to absence of source code or scripts.

Conclusion: Repository consists solely of documentation. No failures detected; no tests available to execute.
# DARPA Audit Report

## Repository Overview

# DARPA Audit Verification Report

## Repository Overview
- Repository root: `/workspace/-`
- Files reviewed:
  - `README.md` – conceptual whitepaper describing "Object-Centered Pi Collapse" framework.

## Audit Findings
- Documentation integrity: The existing `README.md` file was successfully read without errors.
- Code artifacts: No executable code or scripts were present in the repository.
- Test suites: No automated tests or tooling configurations were provided; consequently, no test execution was possible.

## Verification Summary
Because this repository currently consists solely of documentation, there are no runnable components to validate. Should executable modules or test harnesses be added in the future, rerun the DARPA audit with the appropriate commands to confirm operational readiness.
