# DARPA Audit Verification

## Repository Overview
- Total files inspected: 1 (`README.md`).
- No executable code or automated tests are present in the repository.

## Audit Actions
1. Reviewed `README.md` in its entirety.
2. Confirmed the absence of scripts, binaries, or other assets requiring execution.

## Results
- No testable components were discovered; therefore, no automated tests were executed.
- Repository content is limited to documentation-only material.

## Notes
- If additional code or assets are added in the future, corresponding verification and test procedures should be defined and executed.
